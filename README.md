First  cell of the FetchBayc.ipynb is used for extracting data and generating csv. It will save directly to google drive.
Second cell of the FetchBayc.ipynb is used for cleaning the csv we gained above. The csv it generate could given to LLMs for analysis. (Remember that in the row SRC = Path("/content/drive/MyDrive/BAYC/bayc_transfers_20250512_2125.csv"),change the name of csv to the one you need )
Thanks!
